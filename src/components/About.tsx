          About Zenitsu
        </h2>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
          Zenitsu Agatsuma is a Thunder Breathing user in Demon Slayer, often
          underestimated due to his constant fear and self-doubt. However, when
          unconscious or pushed into a corner, he reveals unmatched speed and
          deadly precision, especially with his perfected Thunderclap and Flash
          technique. He has honed this single form to incredible levels, even
          creating his own variation â€” Thunderclap and Flash: Sixfold and
          Godspeed, making him one of the fastest characters in the series.
          Despite his anxiety, Zenitsu has a strong sense of justice and deep
          loyalty toward his friends, especially Nezuko, whom he loves dearly.
          He has incredible hearing abilities, allowing him to detect even the
          slightest movements or intentions in others. Over time, he evolves not
          just in power but also in courage and determination. Zenitsu's journey
          from a scared boy to a fearsome warrior is both inspiring and
          unforgettable.
